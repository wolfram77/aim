Hierarchy of Needs
------------------

Abraham Maslow @ 1943 ; "A Theory of Human Motivation" -> Psychological Review

- Physiological
- Safety
- Love
- Esteem
- Self-actualization

(important) -> communication, education
Physiological needs -> air, water, food, clothing, shelter
Safety -> personal, financial, health, danger
Love -> family, relatives, friends
Esteem -> juniors, friends, elders
Self-actualization -> goal, ideas, actions




Philosophy
----------

- Simple
- Unified
- Modular
- Plastic
- Reusable




Communication
-------------

Transmission of information (randomness) via energy.

- Mechanical
- Electrical
- Magnetic
- Chemical
- Nuclear
- Light
- Heat

Changes to any of these (in spacetime) can be used for communication.
Stored information - disorder of arrangement (in spacetime)



Clothing
--------

clothing - wear cotton - plant flower - made dead - woven
we wear - gets dirty - need cleaning - itself source of chemical colors
bleaching agents - pesticides (cotton is the most pesticide loaded crop) [ref]

what should clothes do
- protect us
- comfort us
- improve looks

what if our cloth was a plant, with it long, wide, thin leaves covering
as much of our body we require. Moving like touch-me-not produce oxygen
for us, protect, photosynthesis, absorb sweat as water sun for photosynthesis
keep us clean (without soap) and make some fruits (leaves). filter our air as well.


- Vertical agriculture
- Green Clothing


what would be the future of food you ask me?
